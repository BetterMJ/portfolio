## About the Project
To display some of my skills I decided to do my own little portfolio. 
## Getting Started
extract folder on for example Desktop, open terminal in that and write:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Go into the server folder ```sh
   cd server
   ```
3. Run the server ```sh
  node app
    ```

The server is now running on "http://localhost:3000/"
